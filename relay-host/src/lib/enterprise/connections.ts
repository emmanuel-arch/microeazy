// Organization → ServiceSuite connection registry.
//
// Each launch org maps to (a) the ServiceSuite EntityId used for tenant scoping
// and (b) a SQL Server connection string supplied via env. EntityIds and conn
// strings are resolved SERVER-SIDE only — the client picks an org slug, never a
// raw EntityId or credential.
//
// Provide the connection strings in .env.local using the SAME .NET-style strings
// ServiceSuite uses, e.g.:
//   SERVICESUITE_CONN_MICROMART="Data Source=<host>,<port>;Initial Catalog=Serviceconnect;user id=<user>;password=<password>;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
//   SERVICESUITE_CONN_AXE="..."
//   SERVICESUITE_CONN_HUB="..."
// Optionally override the EntityId per org (Axe/Hub live on their own servers and
// may not be 3003/0 there):
//   SERVICESUITE_ENTITYID_AXE=...   SERVICESUITE_ENTITYID_HUB=0
//
// SECURITY: ideally each string points at a READ-ONLY, least-privilege SQL login
// with SELECT on Serviceconnect + Transactions only. The guard layer enforces
// read-only regardless, but defence-in-depth starts at the credential.
